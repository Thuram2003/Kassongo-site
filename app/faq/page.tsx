  {
    category: "Pricing & Fees",
    question: "How is shipping cost calculated?",
    answer: "Shipping costs are based on the actual weight or volumetric weight (whichever is greater) of your package, the destination country, and the carrier service you choose (economy, standard, or express).

    category: "Pricing & Fees",
    question: "Are there storage fees?",

  },

  // Package Consolidation
  {
    category: "Package Consolidation",
    question: "What is package consolidation?",
    answer: "Package consolidation is when we combine multiple packages into one shipment. This significantly reduces shipping costs since you pay for one shipment instead of multiple individual packages. We'll remove excess packaging, combine items carefully, and repack everything securely."
  },
  {
    category: "Package Consolidation",
    question: "How long does consolidation take?",
    answer: "Standard consolidation takes 1-3 business days once all packages in your consolidation request have arrived at our warehouse. Platinum members receive priority consolidation, typically completed within 24 hours."

  },
  {
    category: "Package Consolidation",
    question: "Is Kassongo responsible if items go missing during consolidation?",

  {
    category: "Customs & Duties",
    question: "Who is responsible for customs duties and taxes?",
    answer: "You (the customer) are solely responsible for all customs duties, import taxes, and fees charged by your destination country. These charges are in addition to our shipping fees and are determined by your local customs authorities."
  },
  {
    category: "Customs & Duties",
    question: "How do I declare package value?",
    answer: "You must provide an accurate commercial invoice detailing the description and value of contents for each package. Declaring incorrect values can result in customs delays, penalties, or package seizure. It's your responsibility to provide accurate information."
  },
  {
    category: "Customs & Duties",
    question: "What happens if my package is seized by customs?",

    question: "Do I need special documentation for high-value shipments?",

  },
  {
